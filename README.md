# Student Depression
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of 27,901 student survey responses from different Indian institute, to identify key risk factors for depression among the student population, with a particular focus on academic, lifestyle, and financial stressors. The ultimate goal is to enable early detection and inform targeted mental health interventions.
## Problem Statement
Depression is a critical mental health issue globally, with an alarmingly high reported rate of 58.55% among the surveyed student population in India. This condition negatively impacts academic performance, concentration, and motivation, and in severe cases, can lead to suicidal ideation.
## Main Goal
To enable the early detection of depression in students by identifying significant warning signs and risk factors, forming the basis for effective mental health improvement strategies.
## Objective 
Demographic Analysis: How does depression prevalence vary across different age groups and genders?
Academic Indicators: Is there a relationship between depression status and factors like CGPA, Study Satisfaction, and Academic Pressure?
Student Lifestyle: How do factors such as Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, and Work/Study Hours correlate with depression status?
Family & Stress Factors: What is the association between depression and Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness, and the presence of Suicidal Thoughts?
## Data & Methodology
- Dataset
The project utilizes a Student Depression Dataset comprising survey responses focusing on factors that correlate with depression.
Size: 27,901 entries

## Key Findings 
The analysis revealed several strong correlations and insights into student mental health:
Age Group at Risk: The 19−24 age group showed the highest distribution of depressed students, accounting for 43.54% of the depressed cohort.

Academic Pressure & Satisfaction: Students reporting the lowest level of Study Satisfaction (Rating 0) had the highest percentage of depression (≈60%).
Surprisingly, depressed students had a slightly higher average CGPA (7.68) compared to non-depressed students (7.62), suggesting depression is not strictly correlated with low grades but may be linked to high-achieving stress.

Lifestyle Factors: The highest percentage of depression (32.84%) was found in students reporting 'Less than 5 hours' of sleep duration.
A high percentage of students reported Unhealthy dietary habits (44.69%).

Stress and Suicidal Thoughts:
Financial Stress showed a powerful correlation with depression and suicidal thoughts. students reporting the highest level of financial stress (Rating 5), 33.41% were depressed, and 75.71% of this group reported suicidal thoughts.
79.05% of students who reported having suicidal thoughts were classified as depressed, highlighting the severity of the mental health crisis.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, targeted interventions are recommended for key stakeholders:
For Students:
Prioritize Sleep: Aim for the recommended 7−8 hours of sleep, as insufficient sleep is strongly linked to depression.
Monitor Study Load: Be mindful of study/work hours to prevent burnout.
use a time managment skills: Balance is Key, Not Constant Work ,Long, unbalanced study hours are linked to depression. 
For Families:
Emphasize the importance of a student's health and happiness over academic performance. 
Financial Dialogue: Proactively discuss and mitigate financial stress, given its strong link to suicidal ideation.
Create a Supportive Environment: Be aware of a family history of mental illness as a potential risk factor.
For Institutions/Instructors:
Implement Early Screening: Use surveys or tools to monitor students' Study Satisfaction and Academic Pressure levels, which are strong indicators of mental distress.
Promoting sleep and health: Educating students about the importance of sleep and proper nutrition through workshops and campus events

## Limitations
absence of chronological progression of the condition, potential missing aspects of the student's full life complexity, and ignoring other significant factors like social support systems or prior traumatic experiences

## Assumption
The Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction columns are filled with zeros, it might mean the students are not working.
